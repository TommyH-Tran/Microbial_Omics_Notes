Here are notes I have taken from a 6 week video series that was provided by Meren Lab.

# 01 A brief introduction to microbial life and 'omics strategies

* Microbes were the first life forms on earth
  + Microbes sustain the habitable climate of Earth by catalyzing chemical reactions within global biogeochemical cycles
  + Microbial life is extremely abundant and diverse
  
* For a long time observational morphology of life was used
  + We did not know how far into depth we could go to show true diversity at the microbe level
  + Start to learn about microbes from sequencing (comparing their sequences), a higher resolution to compare at.
  + To fully understand life you would have to understand microbes, microbes are like the owners of this planet. 
  + Microbes are able to exploit earth to it's full potential, compared to how humans utilize the earth. 
  
* Ribosomal RNA in easier, cheaper, and shorter time frame to analyze vs. Omics, which can take a long time and be more expensive. 
  1. Environmental sampling and extract DNA or RNA is the same for both RNA and Omics analyizes
  2. However, then apply high throughput sequence strategies to the entire genetic material, whether it is DNA or RNA. 
  3. High throughput omics factors in all members of life vs. just PCR amplicons (can include viruses and many other factors)
  
Vocab:

* Genomics: study of genomes, identify metabolic pathways, look at sequence composition or other properties of genomes.
* Metagenomics: entire DNA content of a given environment, includes many many genomes and they are all in a mixture. 
* Single cell genomics:
* Pangenomics: to what extent are genomes similar to each other, how do the genomes compare to each other? Used when genomes are closely related.
* Phylogeneomics: understanding genomes that are distinct from each other vs. pangenomics. 
* Metapangenomics: understanding how these genomes relate to one another, to their ecology through a metagenomic prespective in a systematic fashion. 

Roland speaker: 

* Each method has it's strong points and flaws, need to combine them.

* Problem in a field that we do not know what many proteins encode for. 

* Low abundance does not mean it is low importance

* Presence of a gene does not mean it is expressed

# 02 The Power Of Metagenomic Read Recruitment 

Amplicon Sequencing: you have an environment, and use universal primers to land on 16s highly preserved sites sites. It allows you to amplify the sites and then sequence them to learn about their differences. (there are many questions that cannot be answered from this method) 
  + very affordable
  + sustained protocol

Shotgun Sequencing: extract DNA from an environment, will include reads that are more than just the primers. Will also get reads from eukaroytic DNA if it is present. Viruses will also be included and plasmids. Takes all reads into account. They called metagenomic short reads. 
  + Takes all reads and small things of an environment that are ignored by primers in 16s.
  + Small things matter, (viruses, plasmids)

Read recruitment: takes metagenomic short reads from shotgun sequencing and tries to map the short reads against a reference genome from a database. You do not need to characterize short reads before mapping them. (Uses the terms detection and coverage)

Genome Resolved Metagenomics: uses shotgun sequencing to get metagnomic short reads and map against reference genomes. 

Vocabulary:
* Plasmids: tiny genomes microbes can exchange
* Prevalence: is the gene present?
* Amplicons: small fragments that allow you to identify organisms 
* Coverage: how much short reads total does it match to reference context for that environment. 8x , 4x etc. The depth. 
* Detection: how much of the full reference context genome is detected in the given environment.
* De novo assembly: taking metagenomic short reads and overlapping them to create a bigger contigs. 
* Metagenomic Binning: the process of using contigs assembled from metagenomic short reads and creating Metagenome assembled genomes
* MAGS: metagenomic assembled genomes from contigs 
* Metagenomic short reads: use these for mapping against reference genomes, short reads can be obtained from shotgun sequencing 

Questions from others:

  + [Zoom question from anonymous]: What is the difference between prevalence and abundance?
Prevalence answers the question "is X in this metagenome?". Abundance answers the question "are there more X in this sample than Y?".
  + [Zoom question from Spencer]: Is a reference sequence always a genome, or can it be a dataset of lots of genes?
Reference sequence can be anything! In next week's seminar, for instance, our reference sequences will be thousands of assembled contigs for read recruitment :)
  + [Zoom question from Gurpeet]: Are primers are used for shotgun sequencing?
n cases when the biomass is extremely low, strategies such as multiple displacement amplification (MDA, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_displacement_amplification ) can be used in metagenomic settings (these are random primers to amplify DNA without a target). But typically shotgun sequencing does not rely on primers.

# 03 Reconstructing Genomes from Metagenomes

k mer # = takes the number of nucleotides and creates a matrix of it. This is how you are able to identify the origination of contigs to a species if you do not know who they belong to. 
  *The longer the sequence of contigs the better for k-mer analysis it is 1000 or more nucleotides sequences is preferred 
  *Tertranucleotide matrix is generally used in the field today k mer = 4
